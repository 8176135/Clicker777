<h2>About this game</h2>
<div style="background-color:#151515; padding:18px 36px; border:double #666666 18px; border-radius:40px">
<p style="font-size:22px; font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; color:#CCC; font-weight:400">This is a incremental game, where you do something repeatitively to get points, and then spend these points to get upgrades and buildings to get more points. And in the end, you will have a mountain of points, which you then get rid of... <span style="font-weight:700; color:#F00">To get more points!</span>

<div style="background-color:#151515; padding:18px 36px; border:double #666666 18px; border-radius:40px">
<p style="font-size:22px; font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; color:#CCC; font-weight:400"><span style="font-weight:700; color:#F00">Completly pointless...</span> Though scientists say that we might enjoy playing this type of game because humans like progress, and having this in the background means you are making progress doing whatever you are doing, and even more progress having something inceasing in the background, thats <b>double</b> the progress!
